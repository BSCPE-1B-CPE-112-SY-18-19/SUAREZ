QUIZ - 1-M : (Palindromic Prime from a desired Range)

 This program will determined the palindromic prime numbers in the desired input range
 Declaring the variables in a long input so that it will have a long number
 Inputing the desired range
 scanning the long input variable range
 Starting the for - loop statement to determine elements starting from '2' within the input range in array form
 Process for identifying the prime number
 Process of determining the the binary of the prime 
 Process of reversing the binary of the prime numbers in the input range
 Process of finding out whether the reverse of the binary prime in the input range is a palindrome
 If binary is equal to the reverse
 Print the "palindromic prime numbers that are in the desired range"

QUIZ - 2M : (Wasteful Number)

 
 This program will determined the wasteful number in the innput number of the program
 Input numbers
 Process of breaking when inputing '0'
 Process of determining the prime factors in each of the number
 Then the process of counting the factors
 Process of counting the number of digits of the specific input/s number
 Process of comparing the number of digits of the specific input number and prime factors
 If prime factors is less than digits
 Print "NON-WASTEFUL NUMBER/S"
 Else 
 print "WASTEFUL NUMBER/S"

MIDTERM : (Palindromic Prime of the Wasteful Prime factors)


 This program will determined the palindromic prime of the wasteful prime factors in the desired range
 Input your desired range
 For - loop statement to determine elements starting from '2' within the range in array form
 Determine prime factors of each element
 Then processing the counting of prime factors of each number
 Process of counting the number of digits of the each element/number
 Comparing the number of digits and prime factors
 If factor is more than digits
 Print "WASTEFUL NUMBER/S"
 Process of getting the binary of each of the wasteful prime factors
 Process of reversing the binary of prime factors of the wasteful number/s
 Process of finding out whether the reverse of the binary prime factos of the wasteful number is a palindrome
 If binary is equal to reverse
 Print only the "PALINDROMIC PRIME FACTORS" of the specific wasteful number that starts w/ a 3-digits binary
